### üìñ  Controlling The Build Version
Both the install and upgrade scripts will check GitHub for the latest release of each module. Specific package versions can be forced by editing the `FORCE PACKAGE VERSIONS` section at the top of each script. 

- _**If forcing specific packages, you must run the edited script manually and not from the auto-link above.**_

### üìß Adding Email Reporting To Community Edition
*(Normally a pro version feature)*

The install script adds the Postfix MTA to enable OpenVAS email reporting capabilities. Configure the included template script `add-email-reports-o365.sh` with your own O365 app password & mail relay configuration.

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upgrading & Updating OpenVAS

- A CVE feed update is scheduled by the installer once daily at a random time. This can be adjusted via cron.
- To upgrade all OpenVAS packages to the lastest releases run  `openvas-upgrade.sh` from the link above, or edited the script to upgrade to specific versions.

- _**If forcing specific packages, you must run the edited script manually and not from the auto-link above.**_

### üîí HTTPS Web Console Access 

The install script automatically configures an HTTP redirect to port 443 and creates TLS certificates based on options in the `CUSTOM CONFIG SETTINGS` section. 

Instructions for importing browser certificates into Windows and Linux clients (to avoid browser HTTPS warnings) are provided on-screen when the install script completes. 

If you wish you change the scanner's DNS name, IP address, or to renew certificates, run `update-certificates.sh`

### üíª Authenticated Scans Against Windows Hosts

To scan Windows hosts using SMB authentication:  

1. Use the PowerShell script `prepare-smb-cred-scan.ps1` to set up Windows systems for SMB credential scanning.  
2. Create a GVM service account, add it to the local Administrators group on each host (ensure it is not a built-in Windows account).  
3. In the management console, configure a new credentials object with the above service account details.  
4. Add Windows hosts to a new scan target and assign the credentials object under _**Credentials for authenticated checks.**_  
5. Create and run or schedule a scan task for the target(s).
